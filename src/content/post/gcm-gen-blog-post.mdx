# GCM-Gen: My New Git Commit Message Generator


First of all, wait what I'm doing here? I'm writing a blog post about my new tool? Checks previous blog post's date, oh right, I'm that late with my next blog post! Sssshhhh ü§´, don't tell anyone! Nervously looking around to see if anyone is watching me write this!

Anyway, I've been working on a new tool for a while now, and I'm excited to finally share it with you. It's called **GCM-Gen** and it's a tool that helps you generate meaningful commit messages quickly and easily, using AI to understand your code changes.

We‚Äôve all been there. You‚Äôve made some changes, and now it‚Äôs time to commit. But when it comes to writing the commit message... you freeze. You want it to be good, but your brain goes blank. That‚Äôs why I built **GCM-Gen**‚Äîa tool that helps you generate decent commit messages without the usual stress.

It‚Äôs early days, and I‚Äôm still figuring out exactly what I want it to do. But for now, it‚Äôs designed to save you time, keep you consistent, and help you avoid those classic ‚ÄúWhat was I even thinking?‚Äù moments when you look back at your commit history.

#### Why GCM-Gen? Because We've All Seen (and Done) This...

![A gif of the git logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/212281775-b468df30-4edc-4bf8-a4ee-f52e1aaddc86.gif "the git logo")

Let‚Äôs be real. We‚Äôve all committed with terrible messages. Here's a couple of classics:

- **"Fix stuff"**
  What exactly was fixed? A typo? A bug? The whole app? This kind of message is a nightmare for anyone looking back at your commit history.

- **"Update"**
  Update what? The README? Some CSS? The database? The vagueness is just... not helpful.

- **"Final commit"**
  Please. We all know that‚Äôs never the final commit. Plus, it tells us nothing about what actually changed.

That‚Äôs why I built GCM-Gen‚Äîto stop us from making the same mistakes over and over. It uses your `git diff` to look at the changes you‚Äôve made and then generates a commit message using custom prompts. The goal is simple: save time and help you stay consistent without overthinking. Run the command and get on with being a kick-ass, awesome developer that we all know you are! (Even if your inner critic tries to tell you otherwise.)

#### The Commands (And Why They‚Äôre Helpful)

Here‚Äôs a rundown of the commands you‚Äôll use with GCM-Gen. They‚Äôre all about making your commit message workflow smoother:

1. **Generate a commit message**
   If you just want a commit message based on your changes, run:
   ```bash
   gcm-gen g
   ```
   It looks at your `git diff` (the changes you‚Äôve made) and generates a commit message for you. No more staring at the screen, wondering what to write.

2. **Generate and commit in one go**
   If you want to generate the message and commit it in one step, use:
   ```bash
   gcm-gen c
   ```
   This command generates the message and automatically commits your changes. Simple and effective.

3. **Check your config**
   To see your current settings, run:
   ```bash
   gcm-gen config
   ```
   This lets you know which AI provider you're using and your config setup.

4. **Edit your config**
   Want to tweak your settings? Run:
   ```bash
   gcm-gen config --edit
   ```
   This opens up your config file, where you can make changes like switching between ChatGPT and Ollama.

#### How It Works

So, what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes? GCM-Gen uses **git diff** to look at your code changes and generates a commit message based on a custom prompt. This prompt guides the AI to produce a consistent, structured message, helping to make sure it follows the right format.

For example, if you‚Äôre fixing a bug, you might get:
```bash
üêõ - Fix user authentication bug
```

Or if you're adding a new feature:
```bash
‚ú® - Add search functionality to dashboard
```

The idea is that you get useful, well-structured commit messages with minimal effort.

#### Why Both GPT and Ollama?

You‚Äôll notice that GCM-Gen lets you choose between two AI providers: **ChatGPT** and **Ollama**. I included both for a reason‚Äîthere‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all solution.

- **ChatGPT**: This is the go-to if you want high-quality, reliable commit messages. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs accurate, and the results are generally top-notch. The catch is that you‚Äôll need an OpenAI API key (and the usage comes with a cost).
- **Ollama**: On the flip side, Ollama runs **locally**. This means no data goes to the cloud, which is great for privacy. It‚Äôs also **completely free** and doesn‚Äôt require an API key. The downside? It can be slower, and it might not always generate the same quality of messages as ChatGPT.

The choice is yours. If you don‚Äôt mind paying for API calls and want the best possible messages, go for **ChatGPT**. If privacy or offline usage is more important, then **Ollama** is your best bet.

#### Requirements (Just A Few Things To Get Started)

To run GCM-Gen, you‚Äôll need a few basic things:

- **PHP 8.1+**
- **Composer**
- **Git**

If you want to use ChatGPT, you‚Äôll need an **OpenAI API key**. For Ollama, you‚Äôll need to install it locally. The detailed setup is in the [README](https://github.com/DR-DinoMight/gcm-gen/blob/main/README.md), but the basics are that simple.

#### What‚Äôs Next?

Honestly, I‚Äôm still figuring out where I want to take this tool. It's early days, and I‚Äôve got plenty of ideas for how to improve it. Right now, it‚Äôs all about making your commit message process faster and easier.

If you‚Äôve got ideas, feedback, or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out! You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/deloughry.co.uk) or drop an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DR-DinoMight/gcm-gen/issues).

#### How to Install

You can install GCM-Gen via Composer with:

```bash
composer global require mdeloughry/gcm-gen
```

Then, just run:

```bash
gcm-gen g
```

And there you go‚Äîcommit messages done in a flash.

#### Final Thoughts

GCM-Gen is still in its early stages, but I‚Äôm excited to see where it goes. I hope it saves you some time and helps you stay consistent with your commit messages. It‚Äôs one small step towards better development practices, and hopefully, it‚Äôll make your life a bit easier.

Thanks for checking it out! And remember, if you have any thoughts, suggestions, or just want to chat, hit me up on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/deloughry.co.uk) or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DR-DinoMight/gcm-gen/issues). Let‚Äôs make this tool even better together!
