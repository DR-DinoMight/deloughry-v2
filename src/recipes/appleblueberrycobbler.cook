>> description: A comforting fruit cobbler with spiced apples, blueberries and a golden biscuit topping.

Heat #oven to 180°C (160°C fan) and butter a @baking dish{23%cm}.

Peel, core, and slice @apple{5%medium} into 5 mm slices.

In a #bowl, combine @blueberries{500%g}, sliced @apple, @caster sugar{100%g}, @lemon juice{1%tbsp}, @vanilla extract{1%tsp}, @cornflour{1.5%tbsp}, and @ground cinnamon{1%tsp}. Add a pinch of @salt. Toss to coat.

Tip fruit into #baking dish. Dot with @unsalted butter{30%g}.

In a #bowl make topping: whisk @plain flour{180%g}, @caster sugar{60%g}, @baking powder{2%tsp}, @fine salt{0.5%tsp}, @ground cinnamon{0.5%tsp}. Cut in @unsalted butter{90%g%cold} to coarse crumbs.

Stir in @whole milk{150%ml} and @vanilla extract{1%tsp} until just combined (thick, spoonable batter).

Spoon batter in dollops over fruit, leaving small gaps. Sprinkle @demerara sugar{1%tbsp} on top.

Bake ~{40-45%minutes} until topping is golden and fruit bubbles at edges. If browning too quickly, tent loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes.

Rest ~{10%minutes} before serving so juices thicken.

Serve warm with @vanilla ice cream or @pouring custard.

>> notes:
- Swap half the blueberries for blackberries in late summer.
- For a less sweet filling, reduce caster sugar to 80 g.
- If apples are very tart, add 1–2 tbsp extra sugar to the filling.
