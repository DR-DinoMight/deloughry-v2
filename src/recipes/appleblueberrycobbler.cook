Apple & Blueberry Cobbler

- Preheat the oven to @180°C{oven_temp} (fan @160°C{fan_oven_temp}) and butter a @23cm{dish_size} baking dish.
- Peel, core, and slice @5{apples} Granny Smith apples into 5 mm slices.
- In a large bowl, combine @500g{blueberries} blueberries, the sliced apples, @100g{sugar} caster sugar, @1tbsp{lemon_juice} lemon juice, @1tsp{vanilla} vanilla extract, @1.5tbsp{cornflour} cornflour, and @1tsp{cinnamon} ground cinnamon. Add a pinch of @salt{salt}. Toss to coat.
- Tip the fruit into the prepared dish. Dot with @30g{butter} unsalted butter cut into small pieces.

-- Biscuit topping --
- In a bowl, whisk @180g{flour} plain flour, @60g{sugar_topping} caster sugar, @2tsp{baking_powder} baking powder, @1/2tsp{salt_topping} fine salt, and @1/2tsp{cinnamon_topping} ground cinnamon.
- Cut in @90g{butter_topping} cold unsalted butter until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.
- Stir in @150ml{milk} whole milk and @1tsp{vanilla_topping} vanilla extract until just combined (a thick, spoonable batter).

-- Assemble & bake --
- Spoon dollops of the batter over the fruit, leaving small gaps for steam.
- Sprinkle @1tbsp{demerara} demerara sugar over the top for crunch.
- Bake @40-45m{bake_time} until the topping is golden and the fruit is bubbling around the edges. If browning too quickly, tent loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes.
- Rest @10m{rest_time} before serving so the juices thicken.

-- To serve --
- Serve warm with @ice_cream{vanilla ice cream} or @custard{pouring custard}.

>> notes:
- Swap half the blueberries for blackberries in late summer.
- For a less sweet filling, reduce caster sugar to 80 g.
- If your apples are very tart, add 1–2 tbsp extra sugar to the filling.
