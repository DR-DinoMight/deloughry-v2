			Aye up, I'm Matt<strike>hew</strike> Peck-Deloughry, a web developer from Sheffield. I've been
			slinging code for nigh on 15 year now and I can tell you, I've developed a reet fondness for it.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll mostly find me professionally using PHP and Laravel, but I like to have a bit of fun
			with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Deno too. There's nowt I love more than creating a problem
			and then figuring out how to fix it with a bit of code. It's like a reet good puzzle!
		</p>

		<p>
			I've worked on all sorts of projects in my time, big and small, and I always approach each one
			with the same level of excitement. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my
			skills, and I love nothing more than bringing ideas to life through code.
		</p>

		<p>
			But it's not just about the code for me. It's about making things, having a bit of fun, and
			always looking for new challenges.
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh, and if you're up for it, you can catch me streaming my coding adventures on Twitch. It's a
			bit of a hoot, if I do say so meself!
		</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			But really I think this sums me up perfectly, I love the challenge of using some language I
			love to solve something, finding the pit-falls and ways out of those said holes Finding
			solutions to problems is what it's all about - using all my "hacks" and "lessons" to produce a
			comprehensive solution..
		</p>
		<p>
			I try to share that enthusiasm in everything I do, from mentoring and streaming to just
			chatting with people. When you love what you do, it makes everything more fun and rewarding.
